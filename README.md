I developed a comprehensive project in Power BI, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data processing, data cleaning, and data virtualization.
## KPI's REQUIREMENT
To analyze key indicators for our insurance business performance, we have identified the following metrics:

- Total Policies Opened: 57K policies have been issued.

- Total Premium Collected: The total premium amounts to $384M.
- Total Claims: The total claims filed amount to $337M.
- Premium to Claim Ratio: The ratio is 114%, indicating that the collected premiums are slightly higher than the total claims.
- Average Premium per Policy: The average premium per policy is $7K.
- Average Claim per Policy: The average claim per policy is $6K.
- Total Claims Count: 2K claims have been registered.
## CHARTS REQUIREMENT
To gain insights into key business trends, we have analyzed the following aspects:
-## Policy Holders by Vehicle Type:
- Top Policy Buyers: Motorcycles (16.2K policies) and Pickups (8.8K) hold the highest share.
- Least Policies Sold: Tankers (0.4K) and Special Construction Vehicles (0.5K) have the lowest policies.
- Claim Trends Over Time:
- A peak in claims was observed between 2014-2016, with the highest claim values coming from agriculture, car hires, and fire-fighting vehicles.
- Claims by Gender:
- 49.67% of claims were filed by category 1.
- 39.46% were filed by category 2.
- 10.86% were filed by category 0.
- Premium vs. Claim Distribution:
- The scatter plot analysis indicates that a majority of claims are clustered in the lower premium range, with a few high-premium policies showing larger claim amounts.

Usage-Based Claim Ratios (Heatmap):

Agricultural Own Farm had the highest claim increase trend, growing by 390% over the years.

Car Hires and General Cartage showed fluctuating but increasing claim trends.

Ambulance and Fire Fighting services also had significant claim activity.

Recommendations for Business Growth
Target High-Demand Vehicle Types:

Focus marketing and policy customizations towards motorcycles and pickups, which have the highest purchase rates.

Manage High-Claim Categories:

Strengthen claim assessment for agricultural and car hire policies to reduce fraudulent claims.

Offer incentives for safe driving and preventive maintenance to lower claims.

Gender-Specific Insights:

Further analyze why category 1 has the highest claims and optimize risk-pricing accordingly.

Premium Optimization:

Since premiums exceed claims by 14%, consider slight adjustments in premium pricing strategies to maintain profitability while staying competitive.

Expand Safe-Sector Policies:

Promote low-risk sectors like tankers and special construction vehicles with discounted rates to increase their policy count.

Final Conclusion
The insurance business is performing well, with policies exceeding claims by 14%. The focus should be on managing high-risk sectors, increasing policy adoption in underperforming categories, and optimizing premium structures. By leveraging data-driven policy pricing and risk mitigation strategies, the company can maximize both customer retention and profitability.
